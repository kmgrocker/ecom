### Product Listing Page

The product listing page is a crucial component of the e-commerce project, showcasing a list of products to customers. The page is built using Next.js and utilizes various components and libraries to provide a seamless user experience.

#### Components Used

- `ProductCard`: A reusable component representing a single product, displaying its image, name, price, and other relevant details.
- `ProductModal`: A modal component that appears when a product is selected, providing additional product information and allowing customers to add the product to their cart.
- `FilterBar`: A component that enables customers to filter products by category, price, and other criteria.
- `Navbar`: A navigation bar component that provides links to other pages on the website.

#### Libraries and Dependencies

- `next`: The Next.js framework for building server-rendered, static, and performance-optimized React applications.
- `react`: The React library for building user interfaces.
- `lucide-react`: A library providing icons and illustrations for the application.
- `@radix-ui/react`: A library providing UI components and utilities for building accessible and customizable interfaces.

## API Endpoints

---

The product listing page relies on the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/products`: Retrieves a list of products from the database.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Retrieves a single product by its ID.

## Database Schema

---

The database schema for the products collection is as follows:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each product (primary key).
- `name`: Product name.
- `description`: Product description.
- `price`: Product price.
- `image`: Product image URL.
- `category`: Product category.

## Code Structure

---

The code for the product listing page is organized into the following directories and files:

- `components`: Reusable UI components, including `ProductCard`, `ProductModal`, `FilterBar`, and `Navbar`.
- `pages`: Page components, including the product listing page (`index.tsx`).
- `api`: API endpoints for retrieving product data.
- `types`: Type definitions for the application, including the `Product` type.
- `utils`: Utility functions for the application.

## Styles and Layout

---

The application uses a combination of CSS and utility-first CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) to style and layout the components. The `globals.css` file contains global CSS styles, while component-specific styles are defined in their respective files.

## Architecture Diagram
